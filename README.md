This repository is a minimalistic setup for running your services with Docker Compose behind Traefik with autogenerated `https` certificates.

Let's say, you have the `API` service (e.g. NodeJS app), React app for frontend and would like to make it available via `https://api.your-domain.com` and `https://dashboard.your-domain.com`, then you are at the right place!

> _HTTPS Backend_ is a part of [starters.dev](https://github.com/starters-dev) collection.

## Getting Started

### Quickstart

1. Connect to the remote server

```bash
> ssh root@IP_ADDRESS
```

> Hint: you can use a cloud computing providers such as [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com).

2. Clone this repo

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/starters-dev/https-backend backend
> cd backend
```

3. Fill in `.env` file with your information

```bash
> mv .env.example .env
> nano .env
```

Check [Environment variables](#environment-variables) section for more information.

4. Get a service repo

> Our example is based on [backend.starters.dev-website](https://github.com/starters-dev/backend.starters.dev-website) repo.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/starters-dev/backend.starters.dev-website services/website
```

5. Build and run

```bash
> bash build.sh
```

It will setup everything, including https certificates, and will start Docker Compose services in the background.

## What's inside

This setup is using [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), the cloud native application proxy, that simplifies the process of getting `https` certificates and the way to describe services.

You can always delete existing (if you don't need them) or add your own services by following the same structure.

### Services

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) - open source object-relational database known for reliability and data integrity. It uses [Bitnami Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/postgresql).
- [Redis](https://redis.io) - open source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker. It uses [Bitnami Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis).
- [React App](https://backend.starters.dev) - sample frontend app. It uses [backend.starters.dev-website](https://github.com/starters-dev/backend.starters.dev-website) repo

## Environment variables

Current setup requires you to fill in `.env` file with variables that are used in services.

```
# [GENERAL]
DOMAIN_NAME=your-website.com
DO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # for DNS challenge
ACME_EMAIL=email@your-website.com    # for let's encrypt
GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # (optional) for private repos

# [POSTGRES]
POSTGRESQL_USERNAME=admin
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=123456qwerty
POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db

# [REDIS]
REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_DISABLE_COMMANDS=FLUSHDB,FLUSHALL
```

#### General

- `DOMAIN_NAME` - your registered domain.
- `DO_AUTH_TOKEN` - Digital Ocean token that is going to be used for DNS challenge and generating https certificates. It's required by Traefik and they provide other options, you can find them [here](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#providers). If you'd like to continue with Digital Ocean, then you can create a token in `Dashboard` -> `API` -> `Tokens/Keys`.
- `ACME_EMAIL` - email that is used for [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) and `https` certificates.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - github token for private repos.

#### PostreSQL

- `POSTGRESQL_USERNAME` - username for PostgreSQL.
- `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` - password for PostgreSQL.
- `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE` - name of the database in PostgreSQL.

#### Redis

- `REDIS_PASSWORD` - password for Redis.
- `REDIS_DISABLE_COMMANDS` - commands disabled from execution.

## Why?

While developing `API` and similar services for mobile apps, you can not really access `localhost` (on mobile device) if, let's say, you have running Docker image on you local machine. Also you have to make only `https` requests from mobile app.

Another reason was to have `PostgreSQL` and `Redis` always running in the cloud but for cheap cost. You can run both of them easily on less than $5 server.
